/**
 * The form a decision is answered with, fitted to the question rather than the
 * same three buttons for every card. Shared by the chat (where decisions are
 * answered and talked through), the Decisions page's one-tap Agree, and the
 * server, which names the answer the same way when it records it. Pure, so it
 * is unit-tested.
 *
 * A card's own form comes from what Firstmate recorded:
 *
 * - the options its question names (server/inbox/options.ts): one call with
 *   options is a pick-then-Decide choice; several calls, or a written answer,
 *   keep the calls as they are (`picks`);
 * - otherwise two plain answers that fit the kind of question (Merge / Not yet
 *   on a merge call, Go ahead / Not like this on work held for the captain),
 *   each one tap; a review question keeps its three calls as a choice.
 *
 * When the captain talks a decision through, Firstmate can replace the form by
 * ending a reply with a `decision-form` block (the discussion message tells it
 * how, see lib/chat/discuss.ts):
 *
 *     ```decision-form
 *     Which should ship?
 *     - Welcome page, tour behind a link: a "Show me around" link opens it (recommended)
 *     - Welcome page only
 *     - Three-step tour
 *     ```
 *
 * Its first line is the question; each `- ` line an option, with `: ` before
 * what it means and `(recommended)` on the one Firstmate recommends; a line
 * `- (written)` asks for a written answer instead. Two options are one-tap
 * buttons; more are picked, then decided. The answer names the option's words
 * (`decided`), which Firstmate receives as the captain's pick.
