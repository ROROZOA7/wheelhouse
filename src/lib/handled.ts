/**
 * Handled by Firstmate: everything on the Decisions page that is not waiting
 * on the captain. Two kinds, both Firstmate's to settle under its own rules:
 *
 * - questions it is settling now: open inbox cards it was not asked to
 *   escalate (a worker's decision, a blocker, the review's questions);
 * - calls it has made: the review questions it answered on the captain's
 *   behalf (the Logbook's Decided for you), from the last week.
 *
 * Either can be taken over: an open one opens in the chat with its form
 * (`/?decision=<card id>`), a made one starts a message to Firstmate saying
 * the captain would decide differently. Pure, so it is unit-tested.
